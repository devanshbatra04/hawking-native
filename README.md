The project is a tribute to the great Doctor Stephen Hawking. He had a long life, which unfortunately involved long years of bad health. However, his contributions to the modern physics have been phenomenal. What would be great is if we supported young people like him, who for some unfortunate reason, succumb to a less than healthy life.

Recent advancements in Machine Learning have enabled us to understand man and disease better, and today with technology easily and cheaply available we can make a huge difference when it comes to detecting and coping with diseases which are largely deemed untreatable by modern medicine.

The project Hawking, like the man himself aims to tackle Autism, Depression and Parkinson. Three unfortunately common diseases that people fail to get any clue about. Knowing about these diseases is critical to treating and addressing them in time, lest they have rather unfortunate results.

We use rather simple computer vision and speech related tests, made possible by the recent developments in neural networks.
We have actually gone the mile to include features which help people with these diseases. Language is a huge barrier for autismic kids. We create an audio tutor which teaches them to communicate and mix well with the public.
